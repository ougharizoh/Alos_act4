                        <p>Cryptome is a useful tool for real-time pricing and market activity for over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. By
                            collecting exchange data from thousands of markets, we are able to offer transparent and accurate data on
                            asset price and availability.
                
                            Our API will offer insight into exactly which exchanges and markets contribute to our pricing.
                
                            For all endpoints, a single page offers 100 responses by default and supports up to 2,000 responses per page
                            upon requests.</p>

                        <p> The currencies price is a volume-weighted average calculated by collecting ticker data from exchanges. Each
                            exchange contributes to this price in relation to their volume, meaning higher volume exchanges have more
                            affect on this global price. All values are translated into USD (United States Dollar) and can be translated
                            into other units of measurement through the /rates endpoint.

                        <p> Take a closer look into exchanges with the /markets endpoint. Similar to the /exchanges endpoint, we strive
                            to offer transparency into how real-time our data is with a key identifying when the market was last
                            updated. For a historical view on how a market has performed, see the /candles endpoint. All market data
                            represents actual trades processed, orders on an exchange are not represented. Data received from individual
                            markets is used to calculate the current price of an asset.

                        <p>The candles endpoint offers a look into how a market has performed historically. This data is represented
                            in OHLCV candles - Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Please note that many parameters are required to
                            request candles for a specific market. Candle history goes back to the inception of an exchange - you may
                            even find data for exchanges that have come and gone!</p>
