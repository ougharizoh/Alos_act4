                <p >   Hospital, an institution that is built, staffed, and equipped for the diagnosis of disease; for the treatment, both medical and surgical, of the sick and the injured; and for their housing during this process. The modern hospital also often serves as a centre for investigation and for teaching.

To better serve the wide-ranging needs of the community, the modern hospital has often developed outpatient facilities,
 as well as emergency, psychiatric, and rehabilitation services. In addition, “bedless hospitals” provide strictly ambulatory 
(outpatient) care and day surgery. Patients arrive at the facility for short appointments. They may also stay for treatment in surgical or
 medical units for part of a day or for a full day, after which they are discharged for follow-up by a primary care health provider.</br>
Healthcare in Algeria consists of an established network of hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries. The government provides universal health care.
